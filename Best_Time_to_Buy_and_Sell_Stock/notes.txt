there are 2 approaches to this problem.

-------------time - O(n) and O(n) space-------------
1. first we create a aux array that store the max elemet of that is available in prices array from that index.
2. them we simply iterate over prices array and sub the element at ith index of aux array and prices array. and we store the max of them .
3. we return the max after iteration.

-----------------time - O(n) and space- O(1)--------------
1. make 2 variable minsofar and maxprofit.
2. iterate over prices array and update the minsofar as minimun of minsofar and ith element of the price array.
3. then calulate the profit as the difference between ith element of prices array and minsofar.
4. update maxprofit if profit is greater than maxprofit.
5. return the maxprofit at the end of the iterations.
