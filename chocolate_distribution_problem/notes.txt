we can solve this problem by sorting the given array or arraylist.

1. sort the array using built-in function(collections.sort()).

2. The idea it to calculate the difference between the smallest and largest value of subarray of length m.

3. we run a loop with exit conditions i+m-1 < n. and calcualte and diff between element at i and i+m-1.

4. we find the smallest diff among all diff and return it.
